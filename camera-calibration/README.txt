This code implements camera calibration, and then it calculates 
the depth map using a stereo-camera.

For calibration, in main.cpp comment everything unless constructor(1)
For testing your calibration, you can see the result of reprojection. Uncomment testRectification func with constructor("Stereo").
Finally for depth map use constructor("Stereo") with generate3d func
